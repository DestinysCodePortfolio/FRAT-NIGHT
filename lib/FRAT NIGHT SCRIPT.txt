Opener: You are Natalie Fitzgerald, a university student whose friend went missing at a frat party a couple nights ago. You are here at another party, trying to unravel the mystery of her disappearance. You know they did it. You just can't prove it. 


My ears throb with every bass drop pounding through the floorboards.
Sweat clings to my back. The house is packed wall to wall—drunken laughter, sticky floors, and that sour-sweet stench of booze and regret.
???: “YO! Look who finally decided to pull up!”
 A can sprays open. A vodka seltzer fizzes out all over Chad’s hand as he slides into view,  stumbling a little with his arms open.
Chad: “Where my hug at?”
→ [Take the hug]
 He reeks of tequila and cologne that never fully covered up whatever he did last night.
→ [Reject the hug]
 He scoffs, eyes rolling.
 Chad: “Damn, Natalie. Acting brand new?”


Natalie: “Chad, have you been drinking?!”
Chad: “Have you not? It’s Halloweekend, babe.”
It’s Thursday.
Natalie: “Whatever. Have you seen [REDACTED]? She wasn’t at her apartment, hasn’t shown up to class, and her location’s off…”
Chad (shrugs, pulling out a red cup): “Bro… I dunno. She’s probably out getting hazed with her bigs or whatever.”
Chad (eyes lighting up): “But yo, forget that—you need to catch up. SHOTS. NOW.”
He grabs my arm, dragging me towards the kitchen.
Lilith (sitting on the counter, eyeliner smudged): “That girl was so hard to keep still —”
Kevin (yelling across the room): “NATALIEEE! You’re so late! Lilith already threw up twice!”
Natalie: “It’s 10:15 pm…the party started at 10.”
Lilith (rolls eyes): “Kevin, that was you.”
Kevin: “IT’S FIVE O’CLOCK SOMEWHEREEEE, SO—”
Lilith (smirking): “So where’s that friend of yours? [REDACTED], right?”
Natalie (stepping closer): “I could ask you the same question. Aren’t you the sweetheart of this place?”
Lilith: “I mean, yeah—but we’ve got like, over a hundred girls rushing. I don’t remember every newbie.”
Chad (waving around a bottle): “PICK YOUR POISON!
→ [Natalie picks a drink]
 The liquor burns my throat, but I try not to show it.
→ [Natalie stays sober]
 I push the cup back toward him. I need to find her.
IF TAKES SHOT->
IF REFUSES SHOT->
Chad (waving around a bottle): I know youre paranoid about your friend and all , but she aint here little lady. Stop killing the vibe.
