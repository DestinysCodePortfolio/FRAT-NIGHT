Project Description
Rush Week is an interactive story-driven mystery game built in C++. The narrative follows Natalie, a college student searching for her missing friend Evelyn, who vanished after rushing for a fraternity. As Natalie explores the campus and uncovers secrets, players will be presented with choices that impact the storyline and determine which ending they receive.

Why this project is important to us
We wanted to create a game that blends the excitement of college life with the suspense of a mystery thriller. Rush Week allows us to practice our C++ programming skills while exploring storytelling, game design, and character development in an interactive format. This project also gives us the chance to integrate art and creativity through custom-drawn sprites and (potentially) a graphical UI in the future.
