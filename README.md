Project Description
Rush Week is an interactive story-driven mystery game built in C++. The narrative follows Natalie, a college student searching for her missing friend Evelyn, who vanished after rushing for a fraternity. As Natalie explores the campus and uncovers secrets, players will be presented with choices that impact the storyline and determine which ending they receive.

Why this project is important to us
We wanted to create a game that blends the excitement of college life with the suspense of a mystery thriller. Rush Week allows us to practice our C++ programming skills while exploring storytelling, game design, and character development in an interactive format. This project also gives us the chance to integrate art and creativity through custom-drawn sprites and (potentially) a graphical UI in the future.

Languages, Tools, and Technologies
C++ – Main programming language

Custom Hand-Drawn Sprites – For character and scene visuals (optional for terminal version)

Terminal/Console – Primary UI for this project

(Optional in future): UI framework for adding a graphical interface

Input/Output
Input: Player decisions made through text-based prompts

Output: Branching story paths and multiple unique endings depending on player choices

Features:
10 minute single user expiernence

No save progess since the game is quick to finish and reseting the game is advised to reach the multiple endings of the game

Player actions will be supported through a limited selection of actions depending on the player's current scenerio

Interactive storytelling with branching paths

Each branching path won't lead to an ending but to a early game over screen depening on player's actions

The player can collect items that will unlock different options that they can choose that can lead to different endings

Players are encouraged to search rooms while they explore the mystery of the game's lore

The areas of the game will be descriced through text and characters will be able to interact with the player to further progress in the story

3 possible endings based on player decisions

One secret ending will be achieved by looking through the files of the game and decrypting the messages to unlock the ending in game through in game user input

Mystery-solving mechanics through dialogue and file manipulation

Hand-drawn character sprites (with possible future UI integration)

Terminal-based user interface for simplicity and accessibility -->
