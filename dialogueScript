Opener: You are Natalie Fitzgerald, a university student whose friend went missing at a frat party a couple nights ago. You are here at another party, trying to unravel the mystery of her disappearance. You know they did it. You just can't prove it. 


My ears throb with every bass drop pounding through the floorboards.
Sweat clings to my back. The house is packed wall to wall—drunken laughter, sticky floors, and that sour-sweet stench of booze and regret.
???: “YO! Look who finally decided to pull up!”
 A can sprays open. A vodka seltzer fizzes out all over Chad’s hand as he slides into view,  stumbling a little with his arms open.
Chad: “Where my hug at?”
→ [Take the hug]
 He reeks of tequila and cologne that never fully covered up whatever he did last night.
→ [Reject the hug]
 He scoffs, eyes rolling.
 Chad: “Damn, Natalie. Acting brand new?”


Natalie: “Chad, have you been drinking?!”
Chad: “Have you not? It’s Halloweekend, babe.”
It’s Thursday.
Natalie: “Whatever. Have you seen [REDACTED]? She wasn’t at her apartment, hasn’t shown up to class, and her location’s off…”
Chad (shrugs, pulling out a red cup): “Bro… I dunno. She’s probably out getting hazed with her bigs or whatever.”
Chad (eyes lighting up): “But yo, forget that—you need to catch up. SHOTS. NOW.”
He grabs my arm, dragging me towards the kitchen.
Lilith (sitting on the counter, eyeliner smudged): “That girl was so hard to keep still —”
Kevin (yelling across the room): “NATALIEEE! You’re so late! Lilith already threw up twice!”
Natalie: “It’s 10:15 pm…the party started at 10.”
Lilith (rolls eyes): “Kevin, that was you.”
Kevin: “IT’S FIVE O’CLOCK SOMEWHEREEEE, SO—”
Lilith (smirking): “So where’s that friend of yours? [REDACTED], right?”
Natalie (stepping closer): “I could ask you the same question. Aren’t you the sweetheart of this place?”
Lilith: “I mean, yeah—but we’ve got like, over a hundred girls rushing. I don’t remember every newbie.”
Chad (waving around a bottle): “PICK YOUR POISON!
→ [Natalie picks a drink]
 The liquor burns my throat, but I try not to show it.
→ [Natalie stays sober]
 I push the cup back toward him. I need to find her.

//IF REFUSES SHOT->
Chad (waving around a bottle): I know youre paranoid about your friend and all , but she aint here little lady. Stop killing the vibe.


Natalie - fine ill find her myself bitch


[look around the house ]
[go outside]

//IF TAKES SHOT->
Kevin (bumping into me): WOOOAAAAAHH THAS LIQA!!!

Lilith: I'm tired of babysitting him, Chad, tag in.”
Lilith grabs my arm and pulls me to the couch

Lilith: So what do you think of Kevin , he's cute huh? 
*well yes *
Natalie:  Dude…
Lilith: My bad I'm just trying to help my bro out. After all, I heard that you and your man just broke up..
→ [Give in: Kevin’s cute, and I wanna know more]
→ [Turn to other matters: I need to find my friend]
IF GIVE IN->
Natalie: He’s cute, I guess - what do you mean by “helping him out”?
Lilith: Oops did that slip out , well i'm too deep in now to not tell you, but i need another shot so WE forget that i told you “

 → [Take another shot]
→ [Decline]

IF TAKE ANOTHER SHOT->
Lilith: Well the reason why he’s so drunk is cause he was trying to get the balls to talk to you again. Ever since yall met, he can't shut up about how he wants to get to know you more - you should go and talk to him right now see for yourself!

[ leave and look for kevin ]
[ walk away  ]
[press her about what happened to REDACTED ]

//IF PRESS HER ->
Lilith : I did what he would have wanted. 
 Lilith: I told you I don't know already, anyway I'm going back in to distract Chad while you get Kevin's attention, tell me how it goes.

//CONTINUE TO KEVIN ROUTE
Narration in her mind:  I see Kevin next to the bathroom, keeping to himself. He doesn’t look like he's doing too well, as if he were about to profusely vomit. 

I sidle up to him, nervous with the revelation that Lilith gave me. We aren’t necessarily close, but we became pretty good friends during our English class, as we did a final presentation together and both became academic victims.

 Kevin: “So, where have you been? I haven’t seen you since our project last quarter.”
Natalie: “WHAT?”
The music is blaring. My ears are ringing.
Kevin: “WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!”
Natalie: “WHATTT???”
Kevin(laughing, gestures to the porch): “OUTSIDE. LET’S GO OUTSIDEEE.”

 Kevin: “Anyways, as I was saying, or rather screaming, what have you been up to lately?”
Natalie: “ I've been looking for [REDACTED]. I haven’t seen her around in a few days, and no one has told me where she is. Have you seen her around?”
[You intensify your glare]
Kevin: Natalie, no one here knows anything. You’re supposed to be her best friend. How would we know, and you wouldn't?
Natalie: BULLSHIT KEVIN
	Kevin: Natalie I swear I dont know.
Natalie: THE LAST NIGHT I HEARD FROM HER, SHE WAS WITH YOU, LILITH, AND CHAD. YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST SEEN HER LEAVE.
           Kevin: She got a ride,  but that's the last we saw of her too. Lower your voice before they hear you.
	Natalie: Kevin, that's it. I'm going to the police like I should have in the first place.
Kevin slams you into the wall and covers your mouth. He drags you towards the woods in the backyard, forcing you to be quiet. He tells you if you stay quiet, he’ll show you the truth.
The air around me seems to grow heavier as Kevin pulls me deeper into the shadow of the woods. The muffled bass of the music from the party behind us does nothing to drown out the growing sense of dread in my gut. I try to keep my footing, but Kevin’s grip is unrelenting.
He slams me against a rough tree trunk, the bark scraping against my back, the suddenness of it stealing my breath. My pulse races in my ears, louder than the thudding beat inside. I try to scream, but Kevin’s hand is already over my mouth, his fingers cold and trembling. 
Kevin:  "You should have kept quiet, Natalie. But fear not,this is a privilege for her and for you. As his children we must obey, he's been waiting for you." “We will all be in his kingdom together, your death will have purpose, your flesh will bring us one step closer to reuniting with our father! επιστροφή σε μας Διόνυσο!”

I writhe in pain as zip ties tighten around my wrists, he pries my jaw open and pours sour wine down my throat. I try to spit it out, but he covers my mouth, forcing me to choke it down. I feel lighter as I accept my fate and see the haze of the candles slowly fade into darkness. I'm sorry Evelyn , I couldn't save you.
*INSERT DEAD NATALIE photo ava marie aaa* 


[You put your hand on his arm, feigning innocent concern]

Kevin(suddenly flushed and stammering): I, I don’t know I’m sorry. All I know is that when someone’s been gone for this long… they probably aren’t coming back Natalie. He stares at you with a pitying gaze, but you can see something else hiding in his eyes. I think it might be time for you to let the police handle it, and for you to move on.
The weight of the situation truly crashes down on me. My throat swells and tears stream down my face. He brushes the tear off of my cheek. Our eyes lock, and my body relaxes. I always thought he was some douche, but this moment feels genuine. Was Lilith telling the truth? 
Kevin: We will find her, I promise. She wouldn’t want you to panic, Natalie. I don’t want to see you like this. 
He hands me a red solo cup
Kevin: We will go to the police station first thing tomorrow, together. But tonight let’s just relax.
[Take shot] -> wake up in woods
[Refuse] -> I know you know something!

//No Shot #2
Lilith: Well then I can’t tell you!
→ [Turn to other matters: I need to find my friend]
 → [I need to find out: Take another shot]


//IF TURNS TO OTHER MATTERS->
The music swells again, loud enough to shake the drywall. I weave through the bodies and pass some guy in a horse mask vomiting into a potted plant. My shoulders brush past strangers who don’t even notice I’m there.

[ bedroom ]

[living room]

[kitchen]

//BEDROOM - NO KEY
The door is locked. 

//BATHROOM -

[check medicine cabinet]
You see Rohypnol, do you take it?
[grab it ]

[leave it , isn’t that what people roofie with ?  Typical frat behavior.]


[check bathtub]

[look in the mirror]
You see her blood on the walls. The smell of metal makes you nauseous. You blink and realize it wasnt real. You see yourself , and you feel her watching too.

//KITCHEN -
*IF THEYRE STILL IN THE KITCHEN*

[open fridge]
 Chad : “YO GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY FRIDGE FAT FUCK”
[look in the sink]

You see hair that resembles hers. You miss her. It looks like someone tried to shove it down the drain. It looks like its been burned.


[open cabinet]
Chad: (voice sharp now, stepping forward)
 “Okay, Natalie. What’s your deal?”
 He’s not smiling anymore.
 “You think this is funny? Snooping through our shit? You wanna get kicked the fuck out?”
 His breath reeks of liquor. His eyes are glassy—but alert.
Something behind them is dangerous.
 Not playful anymore. Just angry. And hiding something.
Natalie : Shit i was just looking for chasers , my bad bro.
Chad : riggghtttt. Well theres limes next to liquor , blind bitch. 
Alcoholic. I wish there was a way to fuck him up more so he could get off my back for five minutes. 

[(If roofies in inventory) SLIP SOMETHING IN HIS DRINK]
[KEEP LOOKING AROUND]

//SLIP SOMETHING IN HIS DRINK - 
Natalie: I’m going to make another drink, do you want one?
Chad: Sure. 

He pulls out a geek bar and leans on the counter. I begin pouring the liquor into two red solo cups, I have to be careful slipping in what I found earlier so he does not notice.

//QUICK TIME EVENT PRESS R AND F REALLY FAST
//ROOFIE SUCCESS
He doesn’t notice. Good. 

Natalie: Here you go. 

Chad takes it and gulps it down. After a few minutes of waiting in the kitchen he begins stumbling even more than he was before. 

Chad: I need.. to find.. Lilith.

He stumbles out of the room. I can open whatever is in that cabinet now.

[OPEN CABINET]

I see a small notepad, inside is a bunch of grocery list items, but one page labeled passwords. 
LAPTOP PASSWORD: MYBALLSITCH18
I put the notebook back and close the cabinet. 

//ROOFIE FAILURE
Shit. Chad looks over. 

Chad: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? THATS IT GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!

I run out of the kitchen and sprint up to the bedroom, I can’t leave yet, not without what I need, I slip the key into the door and lock it behind me.
//GO TO POLICE ENDING


  [TAKE THE COMPUTER TO THE POLICE]
QUICK TIME EVENT-> OPEN THE WINDOW TYPE “OPEN THE WINDOW”

QTE -> RUN PRESS L R 20 TIMES BEFORE A 10-SECOND WINDOW CLOSES
I feel my ankle muscles tense up as I trip over my breath. I feel the blood rushing down my forehead, but I can't give up.
QTE-> GET UP UP ARROW
QTE-> RUN EVEN THOUGH IT HURTS, PRESS L-R REPEATEDLY 20 TIMES BEFORE A 10-SECOND WINDOW CLOSES

“FUCK MY LIFE,”  I CAN HEAR CHAD SCREAMING FROM THE DISTANCE 
QTE-  
//if fail QTE go to kevin kills you ending

I picked up the laptop and jumped through the window; other than a twisted ankle, I make it out unscathed. I hear voices screaming my name behind me, but I am able to sprint fast enough out of there. 

Police Report 2013-> Several murders linked to a local university’s fraternity have begun investigation, students Chadwick Williams, Lilith Catren, and Kevin Chaidez have been brought into custody. Police found footage of the 4 in what looks like a mass homicide. It is rumored that this was a part of a ritual led by Williams as a religious sacrifice to a Roman god named Dionysus. The police found the bodies in the forest after an anonymous individual left a laptop at the Indiana University police department with footage of the suspects brutally murdering 19-year-old Evelyn Gonzalez , a girl rushing for the frat. Some of the bodies were so dismembered that police only found their identities after a DNA report.

//  KEVIN KILLS YOU
My head throbs as I regain consciousness. I try rub my eyes but my hands are tightly bound behind me. It’s almost pitch black but I can make out the shapes of trees bristling in the wind.

I am in the woods?
(same ending)
Kevin:  "You should have kept quiet, Natalie. But fear not,this is a privilege for her and for you. As his children we must obey, he's been waiting for you." “We will all be in his kingdom together, your death will have purpose, your flesh will bring us one step closer to reuniting with our father! επιστροφή σε μας Διόνυσο!”

I writhe in pain as zip ties tighten around my wrists, he pries my jaw open and pours sour wine down my throat. I try to spit it out, but he covers my mouth, forcing me to choke it down. I feel lighter as I accept my fate and see the haze of the candles slowly fade into darkness. I'm sorry Evelyn , I couldn't save you.
*INSERT DEAD NATALIE photo ava marie aaa* 
//BEDROOM
  The room is trashed, and a lone laptop sits open on the desk. It needs a password to open it. Should I look into it or just take it straight to the police?

[TAKE TO POLICE]
[INPUT PASSWORD FOUND ON NOTEBOOK]

//PASSWORD ENDING
The computer unlocks, the desktop is a chaotic mess of files and folders. The file names are written in a different language… is that…Greek? 

[Click on a file]

I found her.
Evelyn…
….
I think I am going to be sick.

THE VICTIMS ARE SMILING.  
THEIR EYES ARE NOT.
